# What is Data-Envelopment-Analysis?
Data envelopment analysis or DEA is a nonparametric method in operations research and economics for the estimation of production frontiers. It is used to empirically measure productive efficiency of decision-making units or DMUs.
# Problem Statment:
To perform DEA analysis on a nursing facility, where inputs: labour working hours and cost of supplies 
                                                     , output: Number of days reimbursed by private and third-party source.
# Aim:
Performing DEA analysis under different assumptions and summarising its efficiency.
